## Generating tag/keywords for the Dockets and Comments

This project aims to solve the problem of Docket Blindness - We are planning to use the **FDA** dockets to create classification tags to flag what information will the FDA need to provide to help better clarify or understand the changes mentioned in the dockets, this will increase accessibility to the 
documents and highlight what dockets are important.

### Results from running a sample of the comments on FDA dockets:


| Type of Information Needed         | Count of Comments |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Scientific/Technical              | 270               |
| Policy/Recommendation             | 134               |
| Policy/Regulatory                 | 85                |
| Policy                            | 75                |
| Procedural/Regulatory             | 62                |
| Procedural                        | 56                |
| Policy/Regulatory Change          | 48                |
| Administrative/Accountability     | 44                |
| Policy recommendation             | 37                |

### Takeaways:
A bulk of the comments that were made requested information clarifying Scientific or Technical information from the FDA on dockets the FDA has published. For example:
FDA-2025-D-0507 had a comment from **Colorcon**, a global leader in film coating systems, modified release technologies, core excipients, and functional packaging for the pharmaceutical industry, requesting **Scientific/Technical** information on **Replacing FD&C Blue No. 1 lake with ferric oxide yellow in an IR tablet coating**

### Limitations
From the information needed codes we can see redunancy and very broad classifications, with better model(s) and prompting techniques this can be solved.
